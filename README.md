# Map

Map is a data structure used in trie.
The role it plays is to efficiently map index to a pointer (or something).
And the domain of the index is the union of the characters legal described in the spec. (26+26+10)

Now, Tony is helping me implement it well.

The version I upload now is a naive version, which has passed the test script. 

# Test script
The test script is the program used to verify the correctness of the map class.
It is always good to have unit test.
